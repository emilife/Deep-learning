## Data Preprocessing

### What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
IS_SUCCESSFUL is the target feature.

### What variable(s) are the features for your model?
varialbe X

### What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
EIN

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

### How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
121 neurons, 3 layers and ativation functions Relu and Sigmoid

### Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
Yes

### What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Added the Name feature and binned it.
